# Knowledge Enchanced Neural Network (KENN)

KENN is hybrid forecasting model that fuses knowledge driven systems (KDS) with Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This repo shares the code of KENN in interactive python notebook (iPython).

## KDS

KDS.ipynb shares the code to get KDS predictions. Change the path in cell 3 to correspond to the path of data file. The output of the final cell is the prediction given by the KDS.

## KENN

File KENN_for SOTA comparison.ipynb contains the code for the KENN framework. Each cell contains comments to guide in training and reproducing the results of the Paper.
